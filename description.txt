Version: 0.0.5, author(s): Gorateron
Changes: moved to a dynamic framework, see thread (homepage)
(basically, creating custom elements & behaviour is now super easy)
See thread (homepage) on how to add your own elements with custom behaviour!
If you want to see how this mod is made, you can get all files by reading it with tModReader or you can see the sourcecode at github.com/gorateron/ElementalWeaponEnhancements

Currently supports: custom elements with:
* NPC / PvP OnHit and ModifyHit hooks (including Projectile hooks)
* Custom damage calculation
* Display names seperate from internal names
* Custom element weight (how rare the element is)
* Custom element player modifiers (similar to vanilla modifiers)

Todo: npc resistances, item blacklist
hmu if you have any suggestions! (leave a post at thread/homepage, pm me on TCF or Discord (Gorateron))
