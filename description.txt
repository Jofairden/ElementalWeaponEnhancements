Version: 0.0.1

This mod adds all four elements as an additional weapon type to any weapon! (earth, water, air and fire)
For now, extra weapon damage is always added.
This mod is an experiment, let me know on the forum if you like it.
The items 'Element Shifter' and 'Chronic Shifter' can be bought from the Merchant after having beaten the Brain of Cthulhu or Eater of Worlds for 5 gold.
Right clicking the Element Shifter will rese the element type of the item first on your hotbar randomly.
Right clicking the Chronic Shifter will reset the elemental damage of the item first on your hotbar randomly.
If you want to see how this mod is made, you can get all files by reading it with tModReader or you can see the sourcecode at github.com/gorateron/ElementalWeaponEnhancements

Each element has its own elemental modifier, similar to vanilla damage modifiers.
Currently, this mod has no items of its own that alter these modifiers, but you can do so yourself.
To access the mod player data, use the following:
ElementalWeaponEnhancements.ElementalPlayer modPlayer = (ElementalWeaponEnhancements.ElementalPlayer)player.GetModPlayer(ModLoader.GetMod("ElementalWeaponEnhancements"), "ElementalPlayer");
Make sure you have the seperate .dll file as reference when using Visual Studio, download it via the thread
Then you can access the modifiers like so:
modPlayer.elementalDamage[index]
The indexes are as follows: 1. earth, 2. water, 3. air, 4. fire
These modifiers work just like regular modifiers, they default to 1f and can be modified to your likings (with accessories for example)
See thread for more examples.
